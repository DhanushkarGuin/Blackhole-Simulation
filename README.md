# Blackhole Simulation

## Still working on this project, probably a normal project trying to implement Machine Learning later on!

Inspiration for this project, [YouTube](https://youtu.be/8-B6ryuBkCM?si=-pYplb0DPwtRbTXP)

Using the above youtube video as a guide but actually implementing on Python.

Hope so I actually complete this project, readme will be updated when things are implemented later on!

The 2d Simulation is done. I am implementing a neural ODE(ML implementation) to reduce the mathematical calculations cost done at each step to calculate the rays' track.
